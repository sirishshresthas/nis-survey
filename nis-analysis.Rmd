## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

library(haven)

tavr <- read_dta("./data/TAVR.dta")

names(tavr)

attach(tavr)
tavr[1:10,]

xvars4 <- c("AGE", "AGE_NEONATE", "AMONTH", "AWEEKEND", "DIED", "DISCWT", "DISPUNIFORM", "DQTR", "DRG", "DRGVER", "FEMALE", "ELECTIVE", "cad", "copd", "obesity", "ckd", "esrd", "anemia", "priorcabg", "MS")

catvars <- c("cad", "copd", "obesity", "ckd", "esrd", "anemia", "priorcabg", "MS")

library(tableone)

tavrdummy <- CreateTableOne(vars = xvars4, data = tavr, strata = "MS", factorVars = catvars)
print(tavrdummy, smd = T, quote = TRUE, noSpaces = TRUE) 




```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
